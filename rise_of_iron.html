		<p class="irontext">The Fallen, one of the five enemy races in Destiny, have breached the inner walls of the last safe haven on Earth, and you have to stop them. This predicament draws out Lord Saladin, the last remaining Iron Lord, who will lead players as they become the next generation of a prestigious line of legendary heroes.
		Your enemies have acquired an SNA Virus, a breakthrough in nanotechnology that provides with them with deadly new weapons and abilities that you've never seen before. In other words, you're in for a challenging treat.
		Rise of Iron will see you travel to a range of new and familiar locations as you seek to discover the mythology of the Iron Lords. Some of the new locales include The Plaguelands, an all-new zone located on Earth, beyond The Cosmodrome.
